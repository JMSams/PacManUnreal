					<p>This page will serve as the design document for the project I will be creating for my visual scripting module.  It will be created in Unreal Engine 4.18 using it's Blueprint editor, and should be playable on Android devices.</p>
					
					<p>My idea for this project is to create something simple, to ease into the new engine and this whole 'coding without code' thing, and then to throw a twist or two into the mix.  To this end I will be re-creating the classic game Pong.  Whilst this is about as simple as you can get, most of the meat of this project will be in the additions and tweaks I plan on adding.</p>
